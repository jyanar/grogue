===============

A productive week. 
* Made the perception be computed using an FOV, just as is done for the player.
  Previously monsters would just check whether the player was X number of tiles
  away, and if so, would start pathing towards them. Computing the list of
  perceived entities using an FOV makes it such that you can lose them if you
  turn a corner.
* Inventory is now dropped on death.
* Switched to a per-entity update instead of per-system update.
* Inventory menu shows glyph and color of item. Just a nice QoL improvement.
* Added animations! None implemented yet, but the ability to add them is there.
