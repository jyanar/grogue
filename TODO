[x] background and interruptible animations
[ ] refactor rest of codebase for background and interruptible animations
[ ]


[ ] blood fx system: attacking enemy could cause blood splatter. could also do something where corpses bleed out slowly (over a few ticks) and change the bg of surrounding tiles.
[ ] corpses made up of body parts?
[ ] throw potions
[ ] staffs, ranged attacks
[ ] other entities can pick up items
   To implement this, we would want to have a setup where during a turn, an entity decides what action they want to take. Turn taking can be like so:
      1. Perceive entities around you.
      2. Decide on goal: pathing towards player, fall asleep, pick up potion, wander. Add this action to the action queue.
      3. Execute goal, and deal with secondary effects: take damage/deal damage, etc.
      4. Death system.

[ ] unified message logging system
[ ] when hunting the player and the player turns around a corner, enemies should path towards the last known location of the player.
[ ] inventory should not be accessible when player is dead
[ ] when selecting where to path, enemies should use far away locations on map (could use djikstra map for this)
[ ] energy system for movement and action taking

done
[x] general animation system
[x] switch to per-entity turns rather than per-system turns
[x] fix pathing, so enemies do not hit each other during normal ambulation
[x] upon death, all items in inventory are dropped
[x] bug observed where player, corpse, and goblin were all standing on the same tile. pathing seems a bit wonky around corpses.
[x] perception system upgraded to be like FOV system
[x] can eat corpses?

==========

Trying to get the new general ECS up and running. But, it looks like things are
getting stuck when we spawn goblins/trolls. It seems like there's something wrong
with the way we're generating entities with Obstruct{} components.
[x] entitiesat(p) bug causing us to always compare player position with itself
