* bug observed where player, corpse, and goblin were all standing on the same tile. pathing seems a bit wonky around corpses.
* can eat corpses?
* blood fx system: attacking enemy could cause blood splatter. could also do something where corpses bleed out slowly (over a few ticks) and change the bg of surrounding tiles.
* corpses made up of body parts?
* throw potions
* other entities can pick up items
* fix pathing, so enemies do not hit each other during normal ambulation
* upon death, all items in inventory are dropped
